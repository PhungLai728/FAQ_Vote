# FAQ - Voting Project at NJIT

This project is to create a website by Laravel Php framework with voting answers from users.

**What can users do with the project?**

1. Users can register an account and have an access to the website.

2. Users can create or see list of questions.

3. Users can answer the questions or can view the answers of other users.

4. Users can judge the answers and vote for them. An upvote if users think the answer is helpful. An downvote if users do not get help from the answer.

5. There are several properties of voting system: 
- Users can only vote once for an answer
- Users can see the list of vote for that question

**How to use Voting features**

1. Register an account.

2. Create a question if no questions exist. To create a question, type your question in "Body" box and Save it.

3. When the question exists, you can create another questions or view the available questions.

4. If there is no answers for the question, you can create answers. 

5. After the answer is created, you can see the buttons "Up-Vote" and "Down-Vote" for the answer. Click "Up-Vote" if you think the answer is helpful or you like it and "Down-Vote" if the answer is not helpful or you do not like it. 


Have fun with the project!

**Problem**

- At this stage, the problem actually does not work as what I expected. The button in the Voting does not work perfectly. It just shows the buttons to vote, and when you click on the button, it will show you the vote data information. For example: whether you go up or down, you can vote or not (one person cannot vote twice), and vote user ID.

- The Heroku is not working well. I met the same issue of "Database [heroku] not configured" as before, even I tried with all steps as Professor did to solve the problem.
